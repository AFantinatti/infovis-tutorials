specific datasets, we can also generate custom data sources by formulating queries against databases.\n","\n","For various topics, there are comprehensive databases that offer multidimensional information across a wide range of domains. Wikipedia's sister Wikidata is particulary broad knowledge base that can be queried using the query language SPARQL. The query syntax may seem a bit daunting, which is because it operates on the basis of triples representing semantic relationships binding entities. In this tutorial, we will not go deeper into the syntax, but it may already help to visit the web-based interface to the [Wikidata query service](https://query.wikidata.org).\n","\n","Queries against Wikidata can be directly issued from the comfort of your notebook using HTTP requests! For this we need the `requests` library again, the URL of the endpoint and the SPARQL query.
